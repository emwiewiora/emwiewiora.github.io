  <h2 class="about-section-header">About Me</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I grew up in a 'small town,' PA, and I have been here most of my life. 
What do people think of when they think of PA? </p> 
<p>3 things:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Horse and buggies</li>
    <li>Farmlands</li>
    <li>Liberty Bell</li>
  </ol>
    
  <p>While most people think of those things when they think of PA,
     I think of computers. My earliest, happiest memories were when 
     my father surprised our house with the Atari 800. OK, I may have 
     given away my age, but don't let that fool you. Due to life, 
     I didn't have the opportunity to follow my dreams and my father's 
     footsteps and launch a career in programming. As sad as that was, 
     life is funny since, due to another life circumstance, I finally have 
     the chance to pursue the job I thought I had always missed out on and 
     would amount to nothing more than just a hobby. I have held positions 
     in every walk of life over my life, from new construction painter to 
     senior technical product trainer. No job has ever been too big or too small, 
     and I thoroughly enjoyed the camaraderie I had with my co-workers at each position.
      Even when I moved to a full-time remote job many years ago, 
      I could still be found answering any questions from any department 
      to ensure our customers were always happy.
  </p>
  <p> When I am not busy working or coding, my wife has informed me that I enjoy anime, farmers markets and claiming I am working on "projects" when I am supposedly not. <em>(I don't think anyone has told her how serious we take our coding.)</em></p>
